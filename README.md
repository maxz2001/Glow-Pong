*****************************************

Thanks for checking out my Unity game, Glow Pong!

This is a two-player game. Left player controls paddle using W (Up) and S (Down). Right player controls paddle using up and down arrow keys.

The first player to score seven points wins.

*****************************************

The game's logic was programmed using C# scripts, which can be found within the 'Glow Pong Code + Assets' --> 'Assets' --> 'Scripts' folder.
